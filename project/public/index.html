	Overview
	<p>
		Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are beginning to have their ability to store value realized as a rapidly growing population is 
		continuously learning about this technology, and widespread adoption isn’t out of the picture as blockchain technology, in general, 
		can solve a myriad of problems. A limiting factor for widespread adoption of blockchain is accessibility, hence, the creation of 
		more exchanges would allow for a heightened ability to handle the influx of new blockchain users to come. With this influx of new 
		users, there is a need to practice trading and gain the confidence in trading through a simple database. Les Tables has created a 
		“training” database for new users to practice trading fictional coins through a fictional exchange. Gathered from Statista.com, the 
		amount of blockchain users has increased drastically from 2015 to 2021 with estimates from 3,677,901 to 34,253,812 -- more than 10 
		times. Another source, Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals states a need for more resources to be accessible 
		to a greater audience, of which there seems to be a need to have more integration of cryptocurrency-like technologies.
